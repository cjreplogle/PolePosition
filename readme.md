#Pole Position

A touchscreen pseudo-3D racing game I developed for the Ohio State FEH Program software design project. 

Only game as far as I'm aware that was able to be programmed with pseudo-3D graphics. 
We were our class representitive at fall 2022 FEH design showcase.
Created in ~a week and I intentionally didn't do any homework on 3D rendering as I wanted to try to make a render myself.
